# Real Estate Development Proposal

Backstory: We are approaching luxury building developers with the proposal of using data-driven analytics to aid in the decision of where to build their next development. 

We will run preliminary data analysis on traffic patterns of MTA stations in combination with key neighborhood characteristics (income, demographics, the presence of other luxury buildings in the area, bar and restaurant types and density) to make actionable suggestions on where favorable potential building sites could be. 

**Factors to consider:**
---
* Proximity to a subway stop
* Proximity to a favorable line 
* Journey time to areas with high office building density in most profitable sectors
* Foot traffic

**Methodology:**
1. Find which stations have the most exits in the morning (7am-11am) during the weekdays
2. Find which lines pass through that station
3. Find which neighborhoods on those lines have high median incomes
4. Find which stations along those lines have relatively low exits
